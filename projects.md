## Current Projects
#### Engaging Spectators in Virtual Reality
Virtual Reality (VR) is being increasingly adopted in education, training, exhibition, and entertainment, lots of which are embedded within specific social contexts. Current uses of
head-mounted display (HMD) support immersive experience by isolating users from the real world, whereas spectators around are only allowed to passively observe a VR user’s firstperson
perspective. This limitation restricts the use of VR in the social context, such as classrooms and museums, where activities take place among a group of people and social
interactions are expected. To better support the use of VR in such inherent social context, this research aims to investigate the interaction techniques for engaging spectators in VR
and to provide guidelines for designing socially acceptable VR experience.

#### Student Projects
I am happy to supervise student dissertations and final year projects in SAT301, SAT405 and SAT406, as well as summer research for HCI/VR/AR related projects.

For XJTLU students who are interested in doing projects with me, please feel free to send me an email: yue.li@xjtlu.edu.cn.
