    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px; color: #333;">Welcome to my website!</h3>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I am a PhD student in Public Policy (Economics Track) at Harvard Kennedy School.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">My research lies at the intersection of the economics of crime, law & economics, and political economy. I am especially interested in how social movements, policy design, and institutional incentives generate or mitigate racial disparities in the criminal justice system. A large part of my current agenda examines the political economy of policeâ€‘alternative programs in the United States.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Before Harvard, I earned an M.A. in Economics at Duke University and served as a research assistant to Professor Bocar Ba and Professor Tony Cheng on policing projects, and to Professor Jonathan Petkun on judicial retirement.</p>
